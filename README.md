## streamer-mode

A simple mod to disable KeyAction Callback messages for being friendly to Streamer's.
This is an Add-on mod for MaLiLib, and only needed for masa's mods from 1.21.1 and below.
Under 1.21.3+, I have introduced the `enableActionbarMessages` config under MaLiLib itself which does the same thing.  

## To use

1. Install mod with MaLiLib, and any dependant mod.
2. Goto MaLiLib Config Menu (A+C).
3. Enable / Disable Streamer Mode.
4. Enjoy Gaming without Keybind Action Bar Messages.
